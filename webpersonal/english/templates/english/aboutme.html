            <p>My name is <b>Nirvana GonzÃ¡lez</b> (Yes!... Like the rock band ðŸ¤˜). From an early age, I've been fascinated by design and computer handling, and over time, I've developed my passion for these areas. Currently, I'm a student at the <b>Autonomous University of QuerÃ©taro (UAQ)</b>, where I'm expanding my knowledge in the field of interface design and backend management.</p>
